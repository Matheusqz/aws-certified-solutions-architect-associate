## Non Relational Databases


## Data Warehousing

Used for business intelligence. Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver.
Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data (such as current performance vs targets, etc)

## OLTP vs OLAP

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) differs from Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) in terms of the types of queries you will run. Usually an OLTP is for fast query, getting a row of information, OLAP is use for getting a large number the records, to do calculations at the data.
Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure layer (at AWS this is Redshift).

## ElastiCache

Elasticache is a web service that makes it aesy to deploy, operate and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
Elesticache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
- Meemcached
- Redis

## RDS

- RDS runs on virtual machines
- You canot log in those operating systeams however
