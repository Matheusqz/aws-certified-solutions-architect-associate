# S3

## Intro

- Object-based
- Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- There is unlimeted storage
- Files stored in Buckets 
- S3 is a universal namespace, names unique in regions
- When upload a file to S3, you will receive a 200 HTTP Code if successfull.
- Object consist in Key, Value, Version ID, Metadata, Subresources (Acess Control List and Torrent)
- Data Consistency: Read after write for PUTS new objects, evencual for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
- S3 Garantee: Built for 99,99%, but garantee 99,9% availability and 99.999999999% durability

## Storage Gateway

Connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless integration with data security features between your on-premises IT environment and the AWS storage infrastructure. You can use the service to store data in the AWS Cloud for scalable and cost-effective storage that helps maintain data security.

## Three diferrent types of Storage

- File Gateway (NFS & SMB): For flat files, stored directly on S3. You can use a file gateway to ingest files to Amazon S3 for use by object-based workloads and for cost-effective storage for traditional backup applications. You can also use it to tier on-premises file storage to S3. You can cost-effectively and durably store and retrieve your on-premises objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols.

- Volume Gateway (iSCSI): Using volume gateways, you can create storage volumes in the AWS Cloud. Your on-premises applications can access these as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) targets. There are two optionsâ€”cached and stored volumes.

  - Stored Volumes: Entire Dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3. With cached volumes, you store volume data in AWS, with a small portion of recently accessed data in the cache on-premises. This approach enables low-latency access to your frequently accessed dataset. It also provides seamless access to your entire dataset stored in AWS. By using cached volumes, you can scale your storage resource without having to provision additional hardware.
  
  - Cached Volumes: Entire Dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is chached on site. With stored volumes, you store the entire set of volume data on-premises and store periodic point-in-time backups (snapshots) in AWS. In this model, your on-premises storage is primary, delivering low-latency access to your entire dataset. AWS storage is the backup that you can restore in the event of a disaster in your data center.
  
- Virtual Tape Library Gateway (VTL): A tape gateway provides cloud-backed virtual tape storage. The tape gateway is deployed into your on-premises environment as a VM running on VMware ESXi, KVM, or Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor. If you are looking for a cost-effective, durable, long-term, offsite alternative for data archiving, deploy a tape gateway. With its virtual tape library (VTL) interface, you can use your existing tape-based backup software infrastructure to store data on virtual tape cartridges that you create. For more information, see Supported Third-Party Backup Applications for a Tape Gateway. When you archive tapes, you don't worry about managing tapes on your premises and arranging shipments of tapes offsite. For an architectural overview, see Tape Gateways.
