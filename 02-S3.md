# S3

## Intro

- Object-based
- Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- There is unlimeted storage
- Files stored in Buckets 
- S3 is a universal namespace, names unique in regions
- When upload a file to S3, you will receive a 200 HTTP Code if successfull.
- Object consist in Key, Value, Version ID, Metadata, Subresources (Acess Control List and Torrent)
- Data Consistency: Read after write for PUTS new objects, evencual for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
- S3 Garantee: Built for 99,99%, but garantee 99,9% availability and 99.999999999% durability

## Pricing Tier

- Standard
- IA
- One Zone IA
- Glacier
- Blacier Deep Archive

## Security and Encryption

By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE. (...)

- Encryption in Transit: 
  - SSL/TLS
- Encryption at Rest (Server side): 
  - S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
  - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
  - Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
- Client Side Encryption

## Version Control

- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, Versioning canot be disabled, only suspended.
- Integrates with Lifecycle Rules
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, with uses multi-factos authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of secutiry

## Lifecycle Managment

- Automates Movin your objects between the different storage tiers.
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning.
- Can be applied to cerrent versions and previous versions

## AWS ORganizations (Sharing Across Accounts)

Account management service that enables you to consolidade multiples AWS account into an organization that you create and centrally manage.

- Always enable multi-factor authentication on root account
- Always use a strong and comple password on root account
- Paying account should be used for billing purposes only. Do not deploy resources into the payting account.
- Enable/Disable AWS services using Sercive Control Polices (SCP) either on OU or on individuals accounts. 

### Sharing Across Accounts

- Using Bucket Policies & IAM (applies across the entire bucket): Programmatic Acces Only
- Using Bucket ACL & IAM (individual object): Programmatic Acces Only
- Cross-account IAM Roles: Programmatic and Console Access.

## Cross Region Replication

- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
- All subssequent updates files will be replicatd automatically.
- Delete markers are not replicated.
- Delete individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.

## Transfer Acceleration

Utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your uploads to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transferthat file to S3.

## Storage Gateway

Connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless integration with data security features between your on-premises IT environment and the AWS storage infrastructure. You can use the service to store data in the AWS Cloud for scalable and cost-effective storage that helps maintain data security.

### Three diferrent types of Storage

- File Gateway (NFS & SMB): For flat files, stored directly on S3. You can use a file gateway to ingest files to Amazon S3 for use by object-based workloads and for cost-effective storage for traditional backup applications. You can also use it to tier on-premises file storage to S3. You can cost-effectively and durably store and retrieve your on-premises objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols.

- Volume Gateway (iSCSI): Using volume gateways, you can create storage volumes in the AWS Cloud. Your on-premises applications can access these as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) targets. There are two optionsâ€”cached and stored volumes.

  - Stored Volumes: Entire Dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3. With cached volumes, you store volume data in AWS, with a small portion of recently accessed data in the cache on-premises. This approach enables low-latency access to your frequently accessed dataset. It also provides seamless access to your entire dataset stored in AWS. By using cached volumes, you can scale your storage resource without having to provision additional hardware.
  
  - Cached Volumes: Entire Dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is chached on site. With stored volumes, you store the entire set of volume data on-premises and store periodic point-in-time backups (snapshots) in AWS. In this model, your on-premises storage is primary, delivering low-latency access to your entire dataset. AWS storage is the backup that you can restore in the event of a disaster in your data center.
  
- Virtual Tape Library Gateway (VTL): A tape gateway provides cloud-backed virtual tape storage. The tape gateway is deployed into your on-premises environment as a VM running on VMware ESXi, KVM, or Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor. If you are looking for a cost-effective, durable, long-term, offsite alternative for data archiving, deploy a tape gateway. With its virtual tape library (VTL) interface, you can use your existing tape-based backup software infrastructure to store data on virtual tape cartridges that you create. For more information, see Supported Third-Party Backup Applications for a Tape Gateway. When you archive tapes, you don't worry about managing tapes on your premises and arranging shipments of tapes offsite. For an architectural overview, see Tape Gateways.
